# nginx-pi-demo

This is [carlpaton/nginx-pi-demo:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/carlpaton/nginx-pi-demo) and is a docker image used with my post on [Raspberry Pi Cluster Swarm](https://carlpaton.github.io/2020/09/raspberry-pi-cluster-swarm/) to simply show which node responded to the request.

Details on how the image was built is at [nginx-pi-demo](https://carlpaton.github.io/2020/09/nginx-pi-demo).
